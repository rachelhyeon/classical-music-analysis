abstract={In this study, we report a corpus analysis of rock harmony. As a corpus, we used Rolling Stone magazine's list of the '500 Greatest Songs of All Time'; we took the 20 top-ranked songs from each decade (the 1950s through the 1990s), creating a set of 100 songs. Both authors analysed all 100 songs by hand, using conventional Roman numeral symbols. Agreement between the two sets of analyses was over 90 per cent. The analyses were encoded using a recursive notation, similar to a context-free grammar, allowing repeating sections to be encoded succinctly. The aggregate data was then subjected to a variety of statistical analyses. We examined the frequency of different chords and chord transitions. The results showed that IV is the most common chord after I and is especially common preceding the tonic. Other results concern the frequency of different root motions, patterns of co-occurrence between chords, and changes in harmonic practice across time. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

@book{doll-2017,
	abstract = {Hearing Harmony" offers a listener-based, philosophical-psychological theory of harmonic effects for Anglophone popular music since the 1950s. It begins with chords, their functions and characteristic hierarchies, then identifies the most common and salient harmonic-progression classes, or harmonic schemas. The identification of these schemas, as well as the historical contextualization of many of them, allows for systematic exploration of the repertory's typical harmonic transformations (such as chord substitution) and harmonic ambiguities. Doll provides readers with a novel explanation of the assorted aural qualities of chords, and how certain harmonic effects result from the interaction of various melodic, rhythmic, textural, timbral, and extra-musical contexts, and how these interactions can determine whether a chordal riff is tonally centered or tonally ambiguous, whether it sounds aggressive or playful or sad, whether it seems to evoke an earlier song using a similar series of chords, whether it sounds conventional or unfamiliar.},

@article{warren-1991,
	abstract = {Familiar melodic phrases were played repetitively with note durations ranging from 40 msec to 3.6 sec. Recognition required note durations approximating those normally used for playing melodic themes (roughly 150 msec to 1 sec per note). Additional experiments with nonmelodic sequences of tones indicated that different rules applied for nonmelodic patterns: Permuted orders of the same items could be distinguished from each other at all durations employed (10 msec to 5 sec per item). Recognition of different arrangements occurred not only when each tone differed in pitch, but also when all tones had the same pitch but differed in timbre. It was concluded that the durational limits for melodic recognition are not based on perceptual limits applicable to tonal patterns in general, but rather reflect special rules governing melodic organization. Hypotheses concerning the bases for these rules are suggested.},

@article{andrews-1998,
	abstract = {There is a range of tempos within which listeners can identify familiar tunes (around 0.8 to 6.0 notes/s). Faster and slower tunes are difficult to identify. The authors assessed fast and slow melody-identification thresholds for 80 listeners ages 17-79 years with expertise varying from musically untrained to professional. On fast-to-slow (FS) trials the tune started at a very fast tempo and slowed until the listener identified it. Slow-to-fast (SF) trials started slow and accelerated. Tunes either retained their natural rhythms or were stylized isochronous versions. Increased expertise led to better performance for both FS and SF thresholds (
r
= .45). Performance declined uniformly across the 62-year age range in the FS condition (
r
= .27). SF performance was unaffected by age. Although early encoding processes may slow with age,
expertise has a greater effect. Musical expertise involves perceptual learning with melodies at a wide range of tempos.},

@article{dowling-2008,
	abstract = {Eighty-one listeners defined by three age ranges (18--30, 31--59, and over 60 years) and three levels of musical experience performed an immediate recognition task requiring the detection of alterations in melodies. On each trial, a brief melody was presented, followed 5 sec later by a test stimulus that either was identical to the target or had two pitches changed, for a same-different judgment. Each melody pair was presented at 0.6 note/sec, 3.0 notes/sec, or 6.0 notes/sec. Performance was better with familiar melodies than with unfamiliar melodies. Overall performance declined slightly with age and improved substantially with increasing experience, in agreement with earlier results in an identification task. Tempo affected performance on familiar tunes (moderate was best), but not on unfamiliar tunes. We discuss these results in terms of theories of dynamic attending, cognitive slowing, and working memory in aging.},

@article{Jimenez-2018,
	abstract = {Musicians can conceptualize harmony in terms of its connection to specific pieces of music. However, research appears to indicate that harmony plays a relatively unimportant role in music identification tasks. The present study examines the ability of listeners of varying levels of musical expertise to identify music from chord progressions. Participants were asked to identify well-known classical and pop/rock pieces from their chord progressions, which were recorded using either piano tones or Shepard tones and were played at six transpositional levels. Although musical training and invariance of surface melodic and rhythmic features were found to have an advantageous effect on the identification task, even some non-musicians were able to identify music from chord progressions in conditions of low invariance of surface features. Implications of these results for our understanding of how listeners mentally represent and remember harmony are discussed.},
